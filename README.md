Tom's Apparel – Minimalistic E-Commerce Store

1. What's the problem? - 
Many budding e-commerce brands or developers looking to build their portfolio struggle to create fully functional online stores that are minimalistic, modern, and secure. Without practical experience with Stripe integration, responsive layouts, and dynamic cart systems, it can be challenging to showcase relevant skills to potential employers.

2. How am I going to solve it? -
Develop a full-stack e-commerce application that:
• Integrates Stripe for secure payments and real-time product data fetching.
• Allows users to browse products, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout.
• Implements a dynamic cart with item quantity management and responsive design.
• Utilizes Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR) and SEO optimization.
• Showcases clean, minimalistic UI styling inspired by modern retailers like ASOS and Bershka.

3. Any issues I came up with? -
• Stripe Integration: Setting up the API for secure checkout and dynamically fetching products and prices from Stripe.
• Cart State Management: Efficiently managing the cart state and syncing it with local storage for persistent user sessions.
• Dynamic UI Design: Designing a responsive and engaging user interface that adapts to various screen sizes while maintaining minimalistic aesthetics.
• Environment Configuration: Managing sensitive environment variables securely in both local and deployed environments.

4. What is the final solution? -

Key features include:
• Stripe Integration: Secure checkout and real-time product data fetching directly from Stripe.
